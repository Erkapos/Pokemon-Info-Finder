# Pokemon-Info-Finder
 A webpage that is created using the Poke API (https://pokeapi.co)
 
 You can try it by going to this link ! https://main--cute-muffin-b9e36b.netlify.app/
 
 This webpage will show regular & shiny sprite, gender ratio, name, and the pokemon's description when you enter the pokemon's name in the search bar
 
 Difficulty i found is when i tried to show the pokemon's description, the data fetch from API is not sorted by language, so i found for some pokemon, the description will shows in other language other than english. The solution i found is when fetch the pokemon's description, and before i show it, the data will be filtered by the language "en", and that solves the problem i meantioned.
